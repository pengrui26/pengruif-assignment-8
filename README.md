# Assignment 8: Logistic Regression

---

**Goals**:

In this assignment, I'll explore the effect of shifting clusters in a dataset on the parameters of a logistic regression model. You will implement parts of the code to:
1. Generate datasets with shifted clusters.
2. Fit a logistic regression model and extract parameters.
3. Visualize the data, decision boundary, and logistic regression results.
4. Analyze how these parameters change with increasing shift distances.
